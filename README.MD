These are the source Maude code for the leaking reservoir problem developed 
for the paper: Towards a Semantic Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems
by Andre Metelo, Christiano Braga and Diego Brandao.

The code was developed for Real-Time Maude 2.3 running under Maude 2.7.1 but
pretty much all versions should work properly.
